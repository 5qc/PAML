# Intro
This is the official respository for PAML (Perfectly Awesome Markup Language), a TypeScript-based HTML add-on that adds much more to HTML, such as if statements and variables!

# Installation
You can install PAML through npm (`npm i paml`) or install it into your website with jsDelivr, in which case you would simply implement this code into your website:
```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/paml" defer></script>
```
or if you want a specific version:
```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/paml@version" defer></script>
```
