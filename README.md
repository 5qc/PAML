# Intro
This is the official respository for PAML (Perfectly Awesome Markup Language), a TypeScript-based HTML add-on that adds much more to HTML, such as if statements and variables!

# Installation
## Command Line
To install PAML via command line, make sure you have [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed. After installing node.js, open up the command line and type `npm i -g paml`.

Upon entering that command, you have successfully installed PAML! If you want to create a new PAML file, you can go to the directory you want and simply type `paml`. After that, a new file will be created. If a file with that name already exists, a prompt will come up, asking if you want to overwrite this file.

Typing `paml` into the command line will automatically set to the newest version. However, if you want a specific version, you can type `paml version`, and it will get that version. For example, you can type `paml 1.1.0` to get version 1.1.0 of PAML.

## CDN
There is also another way to install PAML, with CDN. If you want to install PAML into your website via jsDelivr, you can simply insert this HTML into your website:
```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/paml/index.min.js" defer></script>
```

Or if you want a specific version:
```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/paml@version/index.min.js" defer></script>
```
